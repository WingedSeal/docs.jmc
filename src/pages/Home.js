                <p>Welcome! This is the official documentation for JMC. JavaScript-like Minecraft functions.</p>
                <p>JMC or JavaScript-like Minecraft function is a custom language designed for minecraft datapack which is <span className="fst-italic">inspired</span> by JavaScript. It needs a compiler to compile it down to minecraft datapack.</p>
                <h2>Why use JMC?</h2>
                <p>JMC allows you to write minecraft functions in a better language (.jmc) which is more readable and easier to write. For example, you can declare multiple function in a single file and whitespaces no longer matter which means you can split a single command into multiple line.</p>
                <p>Normal function from .mcfunction file will not work in JMC, the syntax is almost entirely different.</p>
                <h2>How to use JMC?</h2>
                <p>Basically, you just have to create a <code className='code'>.jmc</code> file, write some code, run <a href="https://github.com/WingedSeal/jmc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JMC-Complier</a>, change some configuration and you are done!</p>
                <p>Without further ado, let's <Link to="/getting-started">get started</Link>!</p>
